# TrainScheduler
Objective : Create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

## Overview
This is a mock train schedule app that allows users to store details for new trains in a database. Then print the stored trains onto the schedule panel on the site. Users will also be able to edit select details of an existing train or remove the train from the database completely.

The train schedule will reload every minute to give the most accurate minutes away calculation for the user. I decided to use a progress bar give the user a heads up into what is going to happen behind the scenes and to give a dynamic element to the UI. The user also has a refresh button to manually pull from the database.
